## Assignment 4

Included in here are the `rmd`, `html`, and `swirl` documents, as per the assignment 4 for MSDS 6306.

This covers pulling data out of a package and messing with it, presenting stuff graphically, messing with a few other things.

There is also another file here, ignore it, I was trying to figure out how to push directories. Apparently they have to be non-empty to appear.

Credit for the data used here goes to `fivethirtyeight`, here: https://github.com/rudeboybert/fivethirtyeight/.
